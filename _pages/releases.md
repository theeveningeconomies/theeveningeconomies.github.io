# discography of the label releases

![total victory - english martyrs]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tv-em.jpg){: .align-right} **total victory - english martyrs - jun 2017 eveecono017.** third longer player from total victory. less frenetic and more reflective than it's predecessors a new found confidence in personal lyrics and delicate melodies make this a special record. pressed to wax with now best friends specific and kerviniou, the vinyl is currently sold out if that sort of thing impresses you.

total victory - vs. big electric - sep 2016. a compilation of the band's previous 2 limited run tour cd eps. the first collaboration with the metz based label specific recordings along with old friends kerviniou. there's a few copies of the vinyl left at bandcamp and dotted around the internet.

total victory - if you were there ep - feb 2016. the second limited run cd ep only available at european gigs. these songs were included on the vs. big electric vinyl. just don't ask about the cover. seriously. 

jhindsight - developed film - dec 2015. a hauntological/acoustic/electronic artefact from matt evans, previously of to the bones and total victory.

total victory - tour ep - dec 2013. a limited run cd ep especially for the band's european tour. contained live versions of songs from the first 2 albums plus new tracks which were later included on vs. big electric.

total victory - national service - dec 2012. released a year after the band's debut, national service captures the group riding a creative wave and at the height of their powers. it now seems like a prophetic vision of the country balancing precariously on the cliffs at dover, a crazed glimmer in it's eye.

​the album has been pressed and sold out twice on vinyl (#humblebrag), a collaboration with the labels bruisson, katatak, tandori, kerviniou (the repress also included specific).

the kiss off - shake it up baby now (twist 'n' snarl) - jul 2012. originally recorded in 2009, the master tapes (a cd) were lost, first to booze, then to procrastination, then finally to early onset alzheimers. eventually after some light time traveling adventures containing mild peril, the audio was ready to be released, alas the world was not and we've never been the same again.

the minions - a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs live - jul 2012. a live album taken from gigs at various venues around the north of England between 2006-2009.

princess die - muckhouse - june 2012. princess die (pronounced princess die!) was a band formed as a birthday present, songs which barely break the 1.30 mark were written for each gig usually named after the venue or the bar staff. this really shouldn't have worked but unfortunately it's a great hardcore album.

total victory - body in state ep - july 2012. long deleted ep. to busy themselves in the year it took to record and release the follow up to their debut, members of total victory decided to remix their own debut album. like you do.​

old house playground - god damn that gold - jun 2012. the first band chris brought to the label, a joint release with fat bob records. bluesy, dusty, waitsy and really rather good. 

chris evans collective - the search for the big nineteen - oct 2011. debut and only album from cec. tragic events cut short the life of a gifted voice and lyricist in chris. luckily we have this album to remember him by. blast it out and raise a glass to the boy. for fans of new wave, billy brag, drinking and the dying dreams of the left. 

total victory - the pyramid of privilege - nov 2011. debut album from lancastrian quartet (at the time of recording, shortly after they became 5). back before everyone was krautrock, total victory had a couple of krautrock songs and some great alt rock bangers to go with them. self recorded and mixed the album will be pressed for the first time on vinyl by specific recordings in 2018. 

the minions - everything all of the time - dec 2010. second long player from one of bolton's finest the minions. pigeonholed as ska-punk because they had a brass section and power chords there's so much more going on in this album. from the husker du and heart break of six chords to the john cooper clarke rant along of have you got a knife? via the existential dread of rakt. don't take my word for it, have a listen.

to the bones - astral magic ep - oct 2010. a more focused and coherent collection of songs showing an impressive progression from their debut duke type a. to the bones have always been heavy rock that you can hum and this ep might be their best collection of songs to date.
