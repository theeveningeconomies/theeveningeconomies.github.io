# a history in hindsight...

you may laugh but bolton had an incredible music scene from about 2005 to 2013. living in the shadow of manchester. post music industry collapse. pre streaming and social media domination. a hinterland. no documents exist of that time. 

# label releases

entire catalogue should be available on streaming sites (even the scummy one, you know which one). if not, bandcamp links are in each post below.

![spinsters - LSFTA - ep]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spinsters -lsfta.jpg){: .align-left} **spinsters - love songs from the apocalypse ep - june 2023 eveecono020.** debut ep from bolton 3 piece spinsters. they sound like portishead and low loosened up after a few drinks at a party dancing to set you free by n-trance.

![ghostbird-sky-burial]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/gh-sb.jpg){: .align-right} **ghostbird - sky burial - april 2020 eveecono019.** debut long player from ghostbird. sky burial is our debut album which came out during a weird time in history for pretty much everyone in the world. some of these songs are really old, written a while ago in our 20s, whereas some were written as the album was taking shape and being mixed. it's a record of 2 halves in many ways. bookended by rock bangers, the middle section from pages onwards strays into quieter, more reflective and experimental territory before sailing out of the mist and spume into sea song and smashing onto the rocks of use your feet. It’s this middle section which provided a beacon guiding me to a way of creating in the future which feels more my own. sky burial in the cultures where it was practiced was a positive and necessary function, the remains returning to the earth and the creatures which feed from it providing for the future.
